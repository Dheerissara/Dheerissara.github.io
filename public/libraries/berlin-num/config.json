  "description": "The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS) is a measurement tool designed to assess a computer user's subjective satisfaction with the human-computer interface.  It was developed at the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL), University of Maryland at College Park.  The QUIS contains a demographic questionnaire, a measure of overall system satisfaction, and a measure of specific interface factors such as screen visibility, terminology and system information, learning factors, and system capabilities. This library includes four components, one for each individual scale, as well as a sequence containing all four scales (the full PREVis).",
